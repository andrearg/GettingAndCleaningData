# Getting And Cleaning Data Final Project
This is the final project of Getting and Cleaning Data
The run_analysis.R file creates two tidy data sets.
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The first data set created from steps 1-4 is called  Complete_Dataset
The dataset from setp 5 is called Average_datset
